Keeping up to date in the world of technology can be hard. 

A lot of people rely on twitter for their latest updates and 
information, but I like to keep it old school; relying mailing on emails (and 
reddit, lots of reddit). These resources, coupled with Chrome's 
[Reading List](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/7343019?co=GENIE.Platform%3DiOS&hl=en) 
allow me to keep a healthy backlog of articles and updates.

This is a collection of resources that I use to keep myself informed about 
various subjects across Data Science, Programming and more. It may be updated 
from time to time as I find new things.

### [replit](https://repl.it/signup)

Replit is an online coding environment where people can play around and build 
applications. Their mailing list includes internal tech deep dives alongside 
other interesting things from across the web.

### [The Sample](https://sample.findka.com/)

The Sample isn't a mailing list as such, more of a meta mailing list.
The Sample sends you mailing lists across a huge range of topics and invites 
you to rate them. It then learns your preferences to send you curated topics 
and content that you haven't seen before. I found some of the mailing lists in 
this post through The Sample.

### [O'Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/emails/newsletters/)

Everyone has heard of them, no-one is quite sure what they do. 
Are they a publisher? A consultancy? SaaS? However, they do offer several 
newsletters across a wide range of subjects, from Data Science & Programming 
to Infrastruce, Ops, and even Marketing and Leadership.

The link above lets you sign up to some of these, but you can tailor your 
preferences even more once you're signed up.

### [Console](https://console.substack.com/)

A weekly roundup of the latest in open-source software. A great resource in 
discovering the latest 'hot' git repositories and tools. 

### [Programmer Weekly](https://www.programmerweekly.com/)

A weekly newsletter from all around the programming world. From projects to 
deep dives to papers & articles.

### [Python Weekly](https://www.pythonweekly.com/)

Like programmer weekly but for Python.

### [Python Module Of The Week](https://doughellmann.com/projects/pymotw/)

Now this is a little out of data, and I'm not sure if it is still active. 
However, it does include a great backlog about some of the less-famous yet 
valuable modules hidden within Python.
