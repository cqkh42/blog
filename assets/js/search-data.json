            "content": "Newsletters and Mailing Lists . Keeping up to date in the world of technology can be hard. . A lot of people rely on twitter for their latest updates and information, but I like to keep it old school; relying mailing on emails (and reddit, lots of reddit). These resources, coupled with Chrome’s Reading List allow me to keep a healthy backlog of articles and updates. . This is a collection of resources that I use to keep myself informed about various subjects across Data Science, Programming and more. It may be updated from time to time as I find new things. . replit . Replit is an online coding environment where people can play around and build applications. Their mailing list includes internal tech deep dives alongside other interesting things from across the web. . The Sample . The Sample isn’t a mailing list as such, more of a meta mailing list. The Sample sends you mailing lists across a huge range of topics and invites you to rate them. It then learns your preferences to send you curated topics and content that you haven’t seen before. I found some of the mailing lists in this post through The Sample. . O’Reilly . Everyone has heard of them, no-one is quite sure what they do. Are they a publisher? A consultancy? SaaS? However, they do offer several newsletters across a wide range of subjects, from Data Science &amp; Programming to Infrastruce, Ops, and even Marketing and Leadership. . The link above lets you sign up to some of these, but you can tailor your preferences even more once you’re signed up. . Console . A weekly roundup of the latest in open-source software. A great resource in discovering the latest ‘hot’ git repositories and tools. . Programmer Weekly . A weekly newsletter from all around the programming world. From projects to deep dives to papers &amp; articles. . Python Weekly . Like programmer weekly but for Python. . Python Module Of The Week . Now this is a little out of data, and I’m not sure if it is still active. However, it does include a great backlog about some of the less-famous yet valuable modules hidden within Python. . Got any more great suggestions? Leave them in the comments below. .",
